# Linux Server Hardening

This repository documents a structured Linux server hardening project
focused on secure access control, attack detection, and incident visibility.
The work is based on RHCSA-level administration combined with security-aware DevOps practices.

## Project scope
This project simulates real-world responsibilities of a junior DevOps engineer
tasked with securing an internet-facing Linux server.

## Implemented security areas
- Privileged user access design and SSH hardening
- Brute-force attack analysis and defense logic
- Automated SSH protection using fail2ban
- Security event monitoring with auditd
- System-level security visibility and investigation readiness

## Documented tasks
- Task 1: User access and SSH hardening
- Task 2: SSH brute-force attack and defense design
- Task 3: fail2ban SSH protection
- Task 4: auditd SSH event monitoring

## Goal
To demonstrate practical Linux hardening skills, security reasoning,
and the ability to design, implement, and document defensive controls
relevant to junior DevOps and security-focused roles.

> This repository reflects real configuration decisions and security trade-offs,
